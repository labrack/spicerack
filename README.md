# spicerack
The missing web interface to my literal spice cabinet.

This thing interacts with a database and shows the user the contents of a spice cabinet along with information about each spice. Expiration date reports are also a goal.

Note that this project is just for me to futz around with, and get used to, web application development in python. There are a billion other inventory systems on github, please don't use this one, I'll be terribly embarrassed.
